# Black Olives — Restaurant Landing Page

## (Link to live page)[https://mekintosz.github.io/black-olives/]

I built Black Olives as a fully responsive, single-page restaurant website to showcase my ability to design and develop a polished front-end experience from scratch. The goal was to combine strong visual appeal with functional, user-friendly features.

From a technical perspective:

Responsive design: I implemented a mobile-first layout using modern CSS techniques (flexbox, grid, and media queries) to ensure the site looks and functions well across desktops, tablets, and phones.

Table booking form: Visitors can reserve a table directly from the site through a custom booking form with clear input validation for better usability and data integrity.

Email subscription service: I integrated a newsletter subscription form to capture visitor interest and enable future marketing engagement.

Smooth navigation: A fixed navigation bar with anchor links allows users to jump between sections (Home, About, Menu, Chef, Location) without losing context.

Semantic HTML: Structured content with semantic tags for improved accessibility and SEO.

Performance considerations: Optimized images and minimized CSS/JS for faster load times.

UI/UX design in Figma: I created the layout, color scheme, and component designs in Figma before development, ensuring a consistent visual identity and efficient build process.

This project gave me a chance to combine design skills (consistent color palette, typography, spacing) with practical front-end development techniques that directly translate to real-world client work. It demonstrates my ability to deliver both aesthetics and functionality in a clean, maintainable codebase.
